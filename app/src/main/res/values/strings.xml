    <string name="overview_sample">Students who are prepared for college must have an education that encourages them to take risks as they produce and perform. Our college preparatory curriculum develops writers and has built a tight-knit community. Our school develops students who can think analytically and write creatively. Our arts programming builds on our 25 years of experience in visual, performing arts and music on a middle school level. We partner with New Audience and the Whitney Museum as cultural partners. We are a International Baccalaureate (IB) candidate school that offers opportunities to take college courses at neighboring universities.</string>
